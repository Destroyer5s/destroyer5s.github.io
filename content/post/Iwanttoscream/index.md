Why? Why? Why? My mom found my diary and the only thing she did was make fun of it. why? why? why did she read it, it isnt for her, it isnt hers, so why? I feel betrayed, anger and disgust. I want to go away, far away, please.

I needed to  get this off my chest for now, I am scared to deal with it, I havent talked to her since, i havent looked at her since, i dont want to see her at all. I feel as if I am bare and being laughed at. This isnt fair. This isnt fair. This isnt fair.

worst part is I have no one to talk too, no one to confide in, no one would ever understand though, i hope not.
